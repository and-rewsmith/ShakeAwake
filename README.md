__USE THE XCWORKSPACE AND NOT THE XCPROJECT__

What we did:
We worked primarily on backend for this milestone since front end is easier to fill in. The entire backend component is done which took the most amount of time. We also set up the table view for the alarm selection page. We have seguays for user flow and most pages have been instantiated.

1. We connected our app to firebase so that users will eventually be able to sign in and have their settings saved across devices.
2. we set up Core Data so that users who opt to not have their information saved on the database can still save their settings between sessions on one device.
3. We added functionality so that if there is audio playing, it will stop when the phone shakes.
