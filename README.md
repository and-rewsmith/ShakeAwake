__USE THE XCWORKSPACE AND NOT THE XCPROJECT__

This is SwipeAwake!

It's an alarm app geared towards people who set lots of alarms.

This app will run in the background. In order to turn off triggered alarms, shake the device while in the app.

Everything should be pretty self explanatory.

Have fun!
