# ShakeAwake

  ## Description
  ShakeAwake is an alarm app for iOS which targets users who set many alarms. Alarms for specific times are not created, but exist by default, and are turned on/off by a user. Additionally, users must shake their phone to turn off their alarm.
  
  ## UI/UX
  ShakeAwake uses a black/green color scheme, as it is designed for nightime use. A user will choose an alarm-selection interval which dictates how far apart (in minutes) available alarms are spaced out. Once a user has toggled all desired alarms (via the rightward button in the below picture), they can then start up another app and the alarm logic will run in the background. When the alarm goes off, a user must press a button AND shake the device to turn it off. This ensures they are truly awake!
